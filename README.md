# Campings of Castell√≥

This project contains de development of a basic app using jQuery mobile to retrieve the location of the user and provide a list with nearby camping sites in the province of Castellon. The navigator location API is used to retrieve the users location, and the local government data API is used to obtain data from the camping sites.

Further information and contact details for each location can be also accessed in this app.

The web deployment of the app is accessible through [here](https://rodrigomalagon.github.io/campings-castello/).
